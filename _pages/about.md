Hi! I'm Molin Wu, a junior CS student at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, currently supervised by professor Yunji Chen.

My research interest mainly lies in computer architecture, system, security or any relevant topic. I also explore myself with Model Editing.

I never stop myself from learning and exploring new. I'm eager for an internship opportunity to improve myself.
